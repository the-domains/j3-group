  My first thought upon hearing about the camera, which was officially
  introduced at Facebook's F8 conference earlier this week, was: Who exactly is
  Livestream targeting here? Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with
  people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell
  out for a $399 external camera.
